                                The Thunderbird trilogy is a fast-paced, time-traveling fantasy adventure
                                centered on Noor, a
                                young orphaned Palestinian girl. Beginning in the present, Noor must travel back
                                in time to
                                collect four magical feathers from the phoenix before it burns and save the
                                world. With the aid of
                                a djinn taking the form of a cat and girls who look identical to Noor—each
                                possessing one of the
                                bird’s powers—this initial volume launches Noor on her journey through different
                                historical
                                periods, striving to keep the wall between worlds intact.

                            In this second volume, Noor finds herself in the year 1177 in Jerusalem during the Crusades.
                            With the help of the Djinn and Zainab—a girl who has the power of invisibility—and her local
                            resistance group, Noor must again find a feather belonging to the thunderbird before it
                            burns, to
                            prevent the world of the djinn and other creatures from collapsing into the human world.
                            Along
                            the way, Noor assists the resistance in saving hundreds of books and manuscripts from
                            destruction. Like the first book in the trilogy, Book Two combines magic with real events
                            from
                            Palestinian history, taking the reader on a wild and adventurous ride through time.

                            In the third and final book of the Thunderbird trilogy, Noor finds herself in Byzantine
                            Jerusalem
                            in the year 638 CE, where the city is under siege. Joined by Sabeeka, the djinn who takes
                            the
                            form of a cat, Noor meets the twins Helena and Julian, who possess the power of healing.
                            Together, they team up to find the thunderbird. However, before they can accomplish this,
                            they
                            are swallowed by a giant, worm-like creature which transports them to the world beyond the
                            wall
                            separating the djinn world from the human realm. In the terrifying, dark, gloomy Bacosala’a
                            world of worm–like creatures, Noor and her friends are rescued and delivered to the colorful
                            and
                            peaceful world of the Sakarik. Here, they discover that Bacosala’a are stealing the golden
                            liquid
                            that sustains the Sakarik&#39;s life. Will Noor and her friends rescue the Sakarik and
                            return to the
                            human world in time to find the last two thunderbird feathers needed to save the world?

                            In a tent at the foot of a mountain in Palestine, hundreds of years ago, our storyteller and
                            her twin
                            sister were born. Her name is Qamar (Moon), and her sister is Shams (Sun). Their small
                            caravan
                            is journeying from their mother’s city back to their father’s remote ancestral village atop
                            the
                            mountain.
                            This village suffers from isolation—and a curse—which their young family tries to undo. But
                            when both parents&#39; lives are cut short, Qamar and her sister are left orphans. Qamar
                            decides to
                            pursue her parents’ dreams of discovering the world—its people, places, and stories. With
                            the red
                            book that brought her parents together in hand, she sets out on a daring journey across
                            empires,
                            traveling by caravans and ships.
                            Telling tales to survive, Qamar crosses deserts and seas: to Jerusalem and Gaza, Egypt,
                            Tangier,
                            Andalusia, and Genoa; Abyssinia, India, the Maldives, and Yemen. She faces kidnappers, is
                            sold
                            as a slave to the house of a mad king, studies with a polymath, disguises herself as a man,
                            and
                            falls in love for the first time—with a pirate. Qamar searches irrepressibly for life,
                            uncovering
                            endless stories within stories.

                            reads books and knows how to tell stories. He sought a story that begins and ends with lies.

                            story that
                            began and ended with lies. Just as the prince’s patience began to wane, an ordinary girl in

                            The king wanted his only son and heir to get married and presented him with choices: a
                            princess,
                            a rich girl, or a beautiful girl. However, the prince had a different idea; he wanted a girl
                            who
                            reads books and knows how to tell stories. He sought a story that begins and ends with lies.
                            Girls came from all corners of the kingdom, each trying but failing to tell the prince a
                            story that
                            began and ended with lies. Just as the prince’s patience began to wane, an ordinary girl in
                            a
                            simple dress approached him. She began to tell a most imaginative and fantastical story
                            about a
                            giant rooster that emerged from a round egg , a town inside a water melon and being shot in
                            the
                            sky by a canon and other fantastical details.

                            In a tent at the foot of a mountain in Palestine, hundreds of years ago, our storyteller and
                            her twin
                            sister were born. Her name is Qamar (Moon), and her sister is Shams (Sun). Their small
                            caravan
                            is journeying from their mother’s city back to their father’s remote ancestral village atop
                            the
                            mountain.
                            This village suffers from isolation—and a curse—which their young family tries to undo. But
                            when both parents&#39; lives are cut short, Qamar and her sister are left orphans. Qamar
                            decides to
                            pursue her parents’ dreams of discovering the world—its people, places, and stories. With
                            the red
                            book that brought her parents together in hand, she sets out on a daring journey across
                            empires,
                            traveling by caravans and ships.
                            Telling tales to survive, Qamar crosses deserts and seas: to Jerusalem and Gaza, Egypt,
                            Tangier,
                            Andalusia, and Genoa; Abyssinia, India, the Maldives, and Yemen. She faces kidnappers, is
                            sold
                            as a slave to the house of a mad king, studies with a polymath, disguises herself as a man,
                            and
                            falls in love for the first time—with a pirate. Qamar searches irrepressibly for life,
                            uncovering
                            endless stories within stories.
